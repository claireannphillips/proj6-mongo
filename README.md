## What is happening 
This wensite works with a database to create memos. It creates a memo for you and then it uploads this 
memo to a database and then displays your memo. You can make as many memos as you want and you can 
also delete certain memos. It will sort all of your memos by date and give you an option to delete
a memo.


## How to use 

Clone the repository and then CD into the proj6-mongo. 
Then in your terminal you type "make run" to install the enviornment
and then to see what port the computer is listening on.Then when you have the 
port type in your web browser, localhost:portnumber, which the port number 
will be 8000. Then there will display a button to allow you to create a memo. Click on it to 
create a memo.
